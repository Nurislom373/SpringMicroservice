# Spring Cloud Zookeeper

This project provides Zookeeper integrations for Spring Boot applications through autoconfiguration and binding to the 
Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms. With a few annotations, you can quickly enable and configure 
the common patterns inside your application and build large distributed systems with Zookeeper based components. 
The provided patterns include Service Discovery and Configuration. The project also provides client-side load-balancing 
via integration with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.
